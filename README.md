# Water-Quality-Prediction-Rest-API-on-Streamlit
The project's goal is to create a classification model that can accurately determine if a water sample is safe or unsafe for drinking. This decision is based on factors like aluminium, ammonia, fluoride, chromium, copper, and bacteria levels. To make it user-friendly, the project also incorporates Streamlit, a tool that simplifies the interaction with the model.
